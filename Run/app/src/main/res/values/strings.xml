    <string name="helpText"> The very first marker is already placed for you on the map
        on your current location. This is the place where the route will start.
        You can of course deleted this marker by clicking on it. And choose another starting point.
        If there are some places which you want to see during your run, you can add a marker at that spot.
        To make a good route, it is handy to place your markers mostly at intersection points
        of the streets. You will see immediately the length of the route between the markers and
        if you place more than 2 markers on the map, this app will automatically calculate the distance
        back to your starting point and draw a line. It is also possible to drag your marker and put
        it somewhere else on the map. Your route will be drawn in the order of the set markers.
